# Computer-vision
For learning Computer Vision

This repository contains a simple Python script that uses OpenCV to load and display an image. Below are the details:

## Project Structure
- **Files folder**: Contains the Python script that loads images.
- **Images folder**: Contains sample images to be loaded by the script.

## images.py Script
The `images.py` script loads and displays an image using OpenCV. It performs the following actions:
1. Loads an image from the specified path.
2. Displays the image in a window.
3. Waits for a key press to close the window.

### How to Run the Script
1. Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed on your machine.
2. Place your desired image in the `Images` folder.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Files/images.py

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a crucial step in any data science or machine learning workflow. It helps in understanding the dataset by summarizing its main characteristics often using visual methods. The goal is to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, check assumptions, and test hypotheses.

In this project, we will perform EDA using popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy to analyze and visualize the data.

**Prerequisites**
To run this project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
Additionally, you can use Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE like PyCharm or VS Code for code execution.

**Project Structure**
data/: This folder contains the dataset(s) used for the analysis.
notebooks/: This folder includes Jupyter notebooks with code to perform the EDA.
scripts/: Python scripts used for the analysis if working outside of Jupyter notebooks.
README.md: Overview of the project and instructions.

**Key Libraries**
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrame.
numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of matplotlib providing beautiful default styles and color palettes.
scipy: For advanced statistical analysis.
Steps to Perform EDA

1. Load the Data
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis. You can do this with the read_csv() or read_excel() functions depending on the file format.

Example:
python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/your_dataset.csv')

2. Data Inspection
Inspect the structure of the dataset to get an understanding of its shape and contents.

**View the first few rows:**
python
data.head()

**Check for missing values:**
python
data.isnull().sum()

**Data types and basic info:**
python
data.info()

**Summary statistics:**
python
data.describe()

3. Data Cleaning
Handle missing or inconsistent data to ensure accurate analysis.

**Fill or drop missing values:**
python
data.fillna(value=0, inplace=True)  # Replace missing values with 0
data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop rows with missing values

**Duplicate removal:**
python
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

**Data type conversion:**
python
data['column_name'] = data['column_name'].astype('int')
4. Univariate Analysis
Examine each individual variable on its own to understand its distribution.

**Distribution plots:**
python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.histplot(data['column_name'], bins=30)
plt.show()

**Box plots for outliers:**
python
sns.boxplot(x=data['column_name'])
plt.show()

5. Multivariate Analysis
Explore relationships between multiple variables.

**Correlation matrix:**
python
correlation_matrix = data.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()

**Scatter plots:**
python
sns.scatterplot(x='variable1', y='variable2', data=data)
plt.show()

**Pair plots:**
python
sns.pairplot(data)
plt.show()
6. Handling Outliers
Identify and handle outliers using statistical techniques like Z-score or IQR.

**Z-Score Method:**
python
from scipy import stats
z_scores = stats.zscore(data['column_name'])
data = data[(z_scores < 3)]

**IQR Method:**
python
Q1 = data['column_name'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data['column_name'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
data = data[(data['column_name'] >= Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) & (data['column_name'] <= Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)]

7. Feature Engineering
Transform the data to prepare it for machine learning models or further analysis.

**Creating new features:**

python
data['new_feature'] = data['feature1'] / data['feature2']
Categorical encoding:

python
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['categorical_column'])
8. Conclusion and Reporting
Summarize the findings from the data analysis and create visualizations that effectively communicate insights. Use charts and plots to highlight key trends and statistics.
